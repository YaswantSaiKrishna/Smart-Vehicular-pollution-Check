# Smart-Vehicular-pollution-Check
Vehicular pollution is one of the main causes of air pollution especially in developing countries this is mainly due to lack of proper pollution control boards and proper genuine check of vehicles while issuing puc certificates without proper check. The objective of this system is to implement a smart vehicular pollution checker in real time using azure cloud that detects pollution caused by vehicles in real time and fines them accordingly.
